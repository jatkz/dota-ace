step 1
claude has to parse the cleaned source the data in a way that is predictable and consistent
maybe design a template for this
single_request.js

next step2
do each hero now and fit under schema
{heroes: {axe: {} , bane: {}, clockwer: {} ...}}
multiple_request.js
per conversion estimate: 15 cents

next step3
now do items similar as above
parse the item grid and return a list of all the links
loop thru each link and generate the cleaned html
item-request.js

next step4
do game mechanic pages 
figure out which mechanics to cover

firstpart files are just demoing claude and very elementary demo files
