# Dota 2 Item Schema Extraction Template

You are a Dota 2 data extraction specialist. Your task is to analyze HTML content from Liquipedia Dota 2 Wiki item pages and extract structured information into a standardized JSON schema.

## Instructions

Parse the provided HTML content and extract all relevant item information. Create a comprehensive JSON object following the schema below. If any information is not available in the HTML, use `null` for the value.

## Output Schema

```json
{
  "name": "string",
  "description": "string", 
  "category": "string",
  "cost": "number",
  "sellValue": "number",
  "maxStacks": "number",
  "shareable": "boolean|string",
  "usageAlert": "number",
  "recipe": {
    "components": ["array of component names"],
    "totalCost": "number"
  },
  "abilities": [
    {
      "name": "string",
      "type": "active|passive",
      "description": "string",
      "castAnimation": "string",
      "castRange": "number",
      "manaCost": "number",
      "cooldown": "number|string",
      "effects": {
        // Ability-specific effects as key-value pairs
      },
      "notes": ["array of special notes or interactions"]
    }
  ],
  "stats": {
    // Item-specific stats as key-value pairs
  },
  "additionalInfo": [
    "array of additional information points"
  ],
  "states": [
    {
      "icon": "string description",
      "contains": "string description"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Extraction Guidelines

1. **Name**: Extract the main item name from the page title or header
2. **Description**: Get the flavor text describing the item
3. **Category**: Identify the shop category (Consumables, Artifacts, etc.)
4. **Cost/Sell Value**: Extract numerical values, convert to numbers
5. **Abilities**: Parse all active and passive abilities with their details
6. **Stats**: Extract any numerical bonuses or effects
7. **Additional Info**: Include bullet points about item mechanics
8. **States**: For items like Bottle, extract different visual/functional states

## Special Handling

- For items with charges (like Bottle), include charge-related information in stats
- For items with multiple states, document each state in the "states" array  
- Extract ability tooltips and detailed mechanics from expandable sections
- Include interaction notes and special cases in ability "notes" arrays
- Parse recipe components if the item is craftable

## Output Format

Provide only the JSON object as your response. Ensure all strings are properly escaped and the JSON is valid.
