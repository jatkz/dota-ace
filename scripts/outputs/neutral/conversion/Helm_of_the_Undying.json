        "The wielder enters Death Delay when their health reaches 1, unless they are affected by Shallow Grave, Battle Trance, Wraith Delay, or have Reincarnation",
        "The wielder is kept alive by having their minimum health set to 1. Damage taken is technically not reduced",
        "Death Delay does not trigger for Meepo if one of his Meepo Clones get killed, instead of the prime Meepo who carries the item",
        "Death Delay grants the wielder unobstructed movement, allowing them to move through units, trees, and over cliffs",
        "During Death Delay, the wielder is still alive, so they are still fully targetable and affected by spells and attacks",
        "Since the wielder did not die yet, buffs and debuffs are not dispelled either, like how they would upon death",
        "When Death Delay expires, the wielder dies. The kill is credited to whoever triggered it",
        "The wielder cannot be saved by any means. They will die once the effect expires, even if they are invulnerable, or anything that usually prevents death",
        "If the wielder gains reincarnation during Death Delay, it still triggers regularly and reincarnates the wielder",
        "Death Delay causes the wielder's model size to increase by 25% for its duration. This has no impact on their collision size",
        "While active, enemy heroes that die nearby extend the duration",
        "When crafted with the Dormant Curio, the base duration is increased by 30%",
        "The sound effect only plays when there is a Wraith King within the same match"
