        "Infused Raindrops has the highest priority in the group of damage negating abilities, blocking damage before any of them do",
        "When combined with other damage-negating effects (e.g. Aphotic Shield or Refraction), Infused Raindrops negate the damage while the others do not",
        "Has a higher priority than damage return effects (e.g. Dispersion and Blade Mail), meaning it first blocks damage before it",
        "Has a lower priority than Mana Shield, meaning Mana Shield first reduces damage before Infused Raindrop blocks it",
        "Only triggers on magical damage equal or greater than 75 (before reductions) coming from abilities and attacks, excluding self-inflicted damage and damage dealt by allies",
        "Ignores every form of incoming damage amplification, but does not ignore outgoing damage amplification",
        "Does not stack with other magical damage barriers",
        "If multiple sources of barriers are active on a unit, all of them lose capacity from the same absorbed damage instance",
        "However, if a damage instance is greater than the capacity of all barriers individually, the damage gets blocked as if the barriers were one barrier with combined capacity",
        "Neither consumes charges nor blocks any damage while on cooldown"
