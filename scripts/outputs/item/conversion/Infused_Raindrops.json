        "Has a higher priority than damage return effects (e.g. Dispersion and Blade Mail), meaning it first blocks damage before it.",
        "Has a lower priority than Mana Shield, meaning Mana Shield first reduces damage before Infused Raindrop blocks it.",

        "However, if a damage instance is greater than the capacity of all barriers individually, the damage gets blocked as if the barriers were one barrier with combined capacity.",
